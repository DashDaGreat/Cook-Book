      </ul>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Pork:

          Boil the Pork: Place the pork belly and pork ears (if using) in a large pot. Cover with water and add a pinch of salt. Boil for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the pork is tender. Remove from pot and let it cool.
          Cut and Grill: Once cooled, cut the pork into small cubes. If you prefer a smoky flavor, you can grill the cubed pork for a few minutes until it gets a slight char.</li>
        <li>Cook the Sisig:

          Heat Oil: In a large pan or skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of cooking oil over medium heat.
          Sauté Aromatics: Add the chopped onions and minced garlic. Sauté until the onions become translucent and the garlic is fragrant
          Add Pork: Add the cubed pork to the pan. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pork starts to get crispy and caramelized..</li>
        <li>Finish the Dish:

          Mix in Mayonnaise: Lower the heat and stir in the mayonnaise. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the sisig is well-coated and creamy.
          Add Lemon/Lime Juice: Adjust the seasoning with lemon or lime juice to taste. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Garnish and Serve:

          Top with Egg (Optional): If you like, you can serve the sisig with a raw egg cracked on top, allowing it to mix in with the hot dish.
          Garnish: Sprinkle chopped green onions over the top for added freshness and color.</li>
        <li>Serve: Enjoy your sisig hot with steamed rice or as a side dish. It's often enjoyed with a side of calamansi (Filipino lime) or extra chili peppers for added zing.</li>

         <img src="Lumpia Shanghai.jpg" alt="Lumpia Shanghai" width="300"> 
         <dl>Lumpia Shanghai is a smaller, meatier type of egg roll that we Filipinos are very proud of! You could use pork, beef, or both. It's a very easy and yummy recipe that's great as finger food. We serve these spring rolls with sweet and sour sauce, soy sauce with lemon, or banana ketchup.</dl> 
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
        <li>250g (9 oz) ground pork (or a mix of pork and shrimp)</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt/li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup flour (for binding)</li>
        <li>Lumpia wrappers (spring roll wrappers)</li>
        <li>Cooking oil (for frying)/li>

        </ol>
         <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Filling:

            In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, grated carrot, chopped onion, minced garlic, and green onions.
            Add the beaten egg, soy sauce, salt, pepper, and flour. Mix everything together until well combined.</li>
        <li>Wrap the Lumpia:

            Lay out a lumpia wrapper on a clean surface, with one corner facing you.
            Place a small spoonful of the filling near the corner closest to you.
            Fold the sides of the wrapper over the filling, then roll it up tightly from the bottom corner.
            Seal the edge of the wrapper with a bit of water or a dab of flour paste (flour mixed with a little water).</li>
        <li>Heat the Oil:

            Heat oil in a deep frying pan or skillet over medium heat. You’ll need enough oil to submerge the lumpia, but not too much to make it difficult to manage.</li>
        <li>Fry the Lumpia:

            Carefully slide the wrapped lumpia into the hot oil, a few at a time, without crowding the pan.
            Fry until golden brown and crispy, about 3-5 minutes, turning occasionally for even cooking.
            Remove the cooked lumpia and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Serve:

            Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce, like sweet and sour sauce or a simple vinegar-based sauce.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your crispy, homemade Lumpia Shanghai!</li>

                  Season with fish sauce or salt and pepper to taste. Adjust seasoning as needed.

                <li>Serve:

                  Ladle the lugaw into bowls and top with your choice of garnishes like chopped green onions, toasted garlic, hard-boiled eggs, and a squeeze of calamansi or lemon. Serve with soy sauce on the side if desired.</li>
